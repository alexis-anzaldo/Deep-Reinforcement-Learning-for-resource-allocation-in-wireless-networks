# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-resource-allocation-in-wireless-networks

### This project focuses on improving resource allocation in wireless networks using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. The goal is to enhance the learning of DRL models for power allocation in small-cell and ultra-dense wireless cellular networks. To accelerate learning and improve network throughput, experience replay mechanisms were implemented. The simulations to evaluate the performance of different training strategies with transfer learning were conducted in Python using libraries such as Numpy, Pytorch, and Matplotlib. The results showed that the conventional Deep Q-Network model's learning was accelerated by up to 77%, and the network performance improved by up to 24.7%.

### The project resulted in several research articles published in top-tier journals and conferences in the computer science area.

### Additionally, as a part of the project, a systematic review methodology was conducted to identify the most relevant research works that implemented DRL for resource allocation in wireless networks. The review identified 56 relevant research works and provided valuable insights into the current state of the art in this area.

### Overall, this project has contributed to advancing the field of wireless network resource allocation by leveraging DRL techniques. The proposed learning strategies and experience replay mechanisms can be applied to other network settings, providing a more efficient and effective approach to network optimization.
